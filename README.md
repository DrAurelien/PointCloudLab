# PointCloudLab
Html page to play a bit with point cloud data, and point cloud reconstruction

You just need to transpile the Typscript files (run "tsc" at the project root), and then open index.html with in your web browser.

There's almost no constraint, it's just a "simple" client html page ...
Still, your computer and browser must support OpenGL.

Go to the published page of the project, for a quick preview ;) :
