# PointCloudLab
Html page to play a bit with point cloud data, and point cloud reconstruction

You just need to transpile the Typscript files (run "tsc" at the project rroot), and then open index.html with in your web browser.

There's almost no contraint, it's just a "simple" client html page ...
Still, your computer and browser must support OpenGL.

Got to the project published page for a quick preview ;) :
